## 🤣 Haha - All Jokes!
Agent - we need a website to disguise our espionage mission! Could you build a hilarious frontpage that distracts onlookers from the true intent of the website?

### ❓ Problem
We want to set up a secret website for surveillance purposes, but here's the problem: the site needs to be public-facing! What does this mean? It means that it needs a disguise.

### 💡 Proposed Solution
Using the Jokes API and their [their documentation](https://api.jokes.one/), code a simple website with HTML/JS that gets **The Joke of the Day** and displays it on the website **when a user clicks a button** that says `Show Joke!`. Also, display the **title** of the joke in a `h1` header.

- [ ] Read the documentation
- [ ] Use an Event Handler
- [ ] Display the Joke of the Day and the joke's title!

⭐ **Special Note:** You *do not* have to style your webpage just like the example below! Feel free to be creative or keep it simple.
#### 🚧 Test case:
Navigate to your website and click on the `Get the Joke of the Day` button. Does the website display the Joke of the Day provided by the Jokes API?

Good luck!
